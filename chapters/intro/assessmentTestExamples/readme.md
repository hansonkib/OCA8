### Assessment Code Examples
This directory conatins question example code from the assessment test

### File names
Most of the code examples I was able to name their file what ever I wanted. For some however I was unable to. What mainly stoped me here was code that used instances of itself.

This is a list to map files to questions (where needed).
- Q6 -> MathFunctions.java
- Q8 -> Deer.java
- Q10 -> Grasshopper.java
- Q12 -> Egret.java
- Q14 -> ChickenSong.java
- Q15 -> FindAllTadPole.java
