### Examples and Chapter Review Questions for Oracle Certified Associate 8
This is a simple repository for example programs and chapter review questions written while studying for the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I exam; using the study guide by Jenanne Boyarsky and Scott Selikoff. I do not take credit for the questions and answers found in this repo. They are simply another repition for study. The example code is somewhat made up following examples in the study guide.

### Game Plan
I am going to study at least a single hour every day. When a chapter is complete I will complete the review questions for that chapter.

I am behind.

So, I have been doing good I think; better than I thought I'd do this time. I have been studying consistently 4-5 hours a week. This is obviously not the "single hour every day", but not too bad. I read chapter 4, and I started working on source code to really set-in-stone the concepts I learned. Normally I work on the review questions after reading the chapter. Writing code took time, but was fun.

I plan to go back through chapters 1-3 and work on source prior to moving onto the review questions for chapter 4. (The copying is killing me). I feel I won't go back if I continue forward to the review questions. I am currently done with the code for chapter 4. I don't think the code for the first 3 chapters will take long.

I have slacked some. I am not proud of this. I have continued to work on the chapters that I have already read. I am just doing so at a decreased rate. Hopefully this week I can do better than last. I am going for being consistent over time heads down. Doing something everyday, no matter how small, is more important to me than the amount of time I study each day. I have been trying to do at least 30 mins. I know up there it says an hour. I feel that was a little too ambitious, but continuing at a lesser pace is better than quitting all together. Until next time.

Time again for another update. I have done well this week. I can't say the same for last. I did just complete chapter twos code examples. Good thing I have already done chapter four. Just one more backlogged chapter then on to new stuff! Hopefully I can be more consistent with chapter 3 and get it knocked out in little time. I still enjoy working on the example code. The destractions got me last week. We shall see what the next two weeks bring!

Well I'm back on chapter 4. Finally completed the catch up work. Keep trucking. Two more to go then practice exams. This is seeming somewhat real. 

#### 06/13/18
Finishing up the review questions for Chapter 5, then its on to example code. Then just one more chapter and practice exams. I took off last week while I was on vacation, so it only seems like it is taking longer than usual.
