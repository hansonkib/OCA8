### Example Programs for Oracle Certified Associate 8
This is a simple repository for example programs written while studying for the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I exam.

### Game Plan
I am going to study at least a single hour everyday. When a chapter is complete I will complete the review questions for that chapter.

I am behind.
So I have been doing good I think; better than I thought I'd do this time. I have been studying consistently 4-5 hours a week. This is obviously not the "single hour everyday", but not too bad. I read chapter 4, and I started working on source code to really set-in-stone the concepts I learned. Normally I work on the review questions after reading the chapter. Writing code took time, but was fun.

I plan to go back through chapters 1-3 and work on source prior to moving onto the review questions for chapter 4. (The copying is killing me).
