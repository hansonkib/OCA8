### Example Programs for Oracle Certified Associate 8
This is a simple repo for example programs written while studying for the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I exam.

I am going to study at least a single hour everyday. When a chapter is complete I will complete the review questions for that chapter. Answering and reviewing the review questions will most likely take and hour to and hour plus just on their own.
