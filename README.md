### Example Programs for Oracle Certified Associate 8
This is a simple repository for example programs written while studying for the Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I exam.

### Game Plan
I am going to study at least a single hour every day. When a chapter is complete I will complete the review questions for that chapter.

I am behind.

So, I have been doing good I think; better than I thought I'd do this time. I have been studying consistently 4-5 hours a week. This is obviously not the "single hour every day", but not too bad. I read chapter 4, and I started working on source code to really set-in-stone the concepts I learned. Normally I work on the review questions after reading the chapter. Writing code took time, but was fun.

I plan to go back through chapters 1-3 and work on source prior to moving onto the review questions for chapter 4. (The copying is killing me). I feel I won't go back if I continue forward to the review questions. I am currently done with the code for chapter 4. I don't think the code for the first 3 chapters will take long.

I have slacked some. I am not proud of this. I have continued to work on the chapters that I have already read. I am just doing so at a decreased rate. Hopefully this week I can do better than last. I am going for being consistent over time heads down. Doing something everyday, no matter how small, is more important to me than the amount of time I study each day. I have been trying to do at least 30 mins. I know up there it says an hour. I feel that was a little too ambitious, but continuing at a lesser pace is better than quitting all together. Until next time.
